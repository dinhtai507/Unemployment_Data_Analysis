# Unemployment Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Our project focuses on collecting and analyzing data related to unemployment in the data industry. We have implemented a detailed online survey, inquiring about crucial aspects such as reasons for unemployment, duration of unemployment, and preferred skills.

## Data Collection
By utilizing tools like Google Forms, we have created a flexible survey form, facilitating efficient data collection. Additionally, we have collaborated with professionals within the industry to conduct individual interviews, providing detailed and in-depth information for the project.

## Visualization Stage
Upon completing the data collection phase, we are transitioning to the visualization stage. Using various visual aids such as bar charts, line graphs, and other visualization tools, we aim to illustrate the level of unemployment, trends, and influencing factors. Furthermore, we will employ analytical tools like tree diagrams and charts to create clear and understandable visualizations of the industry landscape.

## Project Results
The results of the project will be consolidated into a detailed report, accompanied by interpretations of the findings and proposed action plans. Our ultimate goal is to provide valuable and comprehensive information to contribute to the improvement of unemployment in the data industry and to support strategic decision-making for the entire community working in this field.
